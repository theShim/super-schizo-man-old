# Super Schizo Man
## Concept
- Dude has schizophrenia
- The user doesn't know this till near the end of the game
- Entire point is that they find out gradually through hints, items, secrets, cutscences etc.
- Therefore the game's name will eventually change
- Each world is one of his delusions and ultimately he's tryna break free from it
- bruh this sht stupid ahh hell

## Intro
>- Begin with opening monologue box with some piano music or rain with typewriter effect (similar to Super Paper Mario, a heavy inspiration)
>- (rn its the l's speech from death note lmao)
>- These monologues should occur after every stage or so and craft its own story on top of the actual game one
>- Haven't decided what that will be, possibly relationships of the player "irl" (referring to outside his delusions), possibly memories, possibly what's actually happening "irl" at that momen

### Transition

>- Then play that blinking effect, have the player wake up in the grassy area. Probably use the perlin background
>- Have the butterfly wake you up and talk to you.
>- The butterfly voiced by (@hura_crepitans) will act as a guide but witty and often stupid/useless.
>- Maybe have an ability to click on enemies to highlight features about it like health and general description

###

>- The grassy area will then act as a tutorial area and then connected into the first world directly via some sort of cutscene/interaction with an npc.


## Stage 1 - Grassy Area

### Initial dialogue
- Begin with dialogue with some guy at a house or something maybe a cabin
- Have him talk abot some generic boss and tells you its location
- Follow the butterfly's instructions to get there, but he should generally be annoying as hell (hence yunyang's the VA for it)

>- Transition from grassy area to denser forest to darker undergrodun area?

### Area 1
>- Get to know attacks n stuff
>- Dense grass and flowers and stuff
>- Have some npcs dotted around during progression speaking about the knight dude (hes a right dickhead)

### Area 2
>- Background shift to more denser foliage? Maybe make the parallax less shifty and larger


### Area 3
>- Maybe some shaky bridge type thing
>- Onslaught of enemies on the bridge
>- In the middle have it become quiet in the music n sht
>- Some attack breaks the bridge in the middle or from the start of it
>- Fall into the area down

### Area 4
>- Explore underground area, should be knight dickhead's minions

### Area 5
>- Basically just his front door

### Final Boss

>- Have some sort of shadow knight? Literally ripping off solo leveling with igris
>- In a dungeon underground
